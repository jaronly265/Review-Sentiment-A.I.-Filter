## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

The majority of sentiments were negative with over 40 negative reviews.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

The labels generated are reliable, looking at the sentiments generated from the first few reviews, the model accurately interprets strong adjectives like 'disappointing', 'disgusting' and 'liked' and categorizes them . 

Hallucinations introduce the risk of inaccurate reviews sentiments which give us false information about our product.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

I would recommend a complete rethinkin gof the product. There are almost two times the amount of negative reviews compared to positive ones. Most of the negative customer reviews mention an aftertaste or that the taste is off or unnatural. I'd recommend Zico use a larger ratio of fresh juice to coconut flavoring.
